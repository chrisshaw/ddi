            <p class="lead">Hey. This is Chris, the founder of DDI.</p>
            <p>I started DDI because I noticed that the non-profits I wanted to support were filled with amazing people. People with passion and vision and the chops to make the world a better place.</p>
            <p>What they didn't always have were the time or resources to keep up with every twist and turn introduced to them by the ever-changing modern world.</p>
            <p>They faced problems like clunky digital presences, manual processes, rusty business models, and stalling impact, all on top of, you know, running an organization.</p>
            <p>I decided that these giving, visionary, intelligent, tenacious people who care more deeply and can do more with a dollar than anyone shouldn't have to take gobs of time or resources away from their causes. They should be doing what they do best: improving the world.</p>
            <p>So I started DDI, a launchpad for do-gooders. It's my way of saying, "that business transformation, that new technology, that new website, that new idea, that wicked problem? Relax. You worry about impact. I'll help you take care of the rest."</p>
            <p>DDI is a pending 501(c)(3) with a four-branch approach to helping do-gooders do good:</p>
            <ul id="branches">
              <li><strong>The Robin Hood business model:</strong> use income from awesome private companies that pay for DDI services to subsidize providing those services to charities.</li>
              <li><strong>The Good Karma network:</strong> make sponsoring and supporting non-profits attractive to private companies through DDI and non-profit client services, incentives, connections, and communities.</li>
              <li><strong>The Actual Budget budget:</strong> we only spend money we actually have, bootstrapping our profitability from day 1. Living within our means enables the next branch, which is...</li>
              <li><strong>The Actual Non-profit profit:</strong> donate any surplus remaining at the end of the year back to the non-profit clients taken that year.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Keep on making the world a better place for us all, do-gooders. DDI is here to help.</p>
