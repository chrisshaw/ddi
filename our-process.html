            <p class="lead">Combining the best from design, lean, economics, and data science to tackle the toughest challenges.</p>
            <p>We've packaged our extensive expertise and robust toolkit into an adaptable process suitable for most bottom-line challenges. If you're looking to move the needle (or get started) on growth, costs, or impact, we're here to help.</p>
            <p>Our focus on refinment and innovation doesn't stop with our partners and clients. DDI has a constantly growing knowledge across diverse industries, proven best practices, and cutting-edge applied sciences, so you can expect to develop solutions with us that are appropriate, optimal, and future-proof.</p>
            <p>Finally, we follow the Einsteinian adage to make everything as simple as it can be (but not simpler!). We'll partner with you to customize each engagement to fit your budget, timeline, and challenge.</p>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>
                <h2>Discover</h2>
                <p>We start by learning about your situation by partnering with the experts: you. With a vision, strategy, and objectives, we'll gather the insights we need to shape our understanding of the challenge and the best way to solve it.</p>
                <p>Together, we may study customers, dig into data and financials, analyze competitors, map processes, research technology, and more.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h2>Decree</h2>
                <p>Defining the right problem is so important that we gave it its own stage. Well-defined problems lead to equally well-defined solutions that can be focused on, accurately assessed, and acted on.</p>
                <p>With your help we'll rigorously distill our insights into the most critical issues and assumptions. If we haven't already, we'll bring in your and our number nerds, systems thinkers, and clairvoyants.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>Problem-solving is about admitting we don't know the future (yet). This is where we start turning ideas into tangible, testable solutions as rapidly and frugally as possible.</p>
                <p>You might encounter sticky notes, data models, code, cardboard, and not-your-granny's-brainstorms. We'll then progressively eliminate and evolve options through qualitative and quantitative experiments.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h2>Develop</h2>
                <p>Once we've identified the best one or more solutions, we'll help you implement at scale, borrowing concepts from lean, Agile, and organizational and behavior design.</p>
                <p>We'll get as involved as you ask us to in developing technology, negotiating partnerships and acquisitions, and establishing new processes, incentives, and behaviors.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h2>Deploy</h2>
                <p>Sometimes all you need is a big red button. Sometimes deployment can be a lot more strategic.</p>
                <p>We'll partner with your people on planning go-live timelines, go-to-market strategies, and launch campaigns. Finally, we'll support a seamless transition with support, training, and documentation.</p>
