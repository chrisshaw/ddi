Locally-owned, family-owned Shoaff Park Villas Apartments prides itself on providing affordable housing in a great location with a professionalism unmatched in the price range. With competition heating up and demographics and rental preferences shifting in the area, SPV wanted to reinvent its web presence to reinforce its core values while meeting the evolving needs of its customers.

SPV had three main objectives: launch a beautiful, usable site that called attention to its best features, improve its placement in search engines, and move rental payments online and out of the back office.

In 12 weeks, DDI overhauled the website, incorporating SEO practices and highlighting the great location, neighborly culture, and the top-requested features from customers. By applying principles from design thinking and behavioral economics to the design, we drove up usage of the online payment portal 60%, cutting costs and improving customer satisfaction.
