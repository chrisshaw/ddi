Chicago-based social startup Simplease was incubating a personal coaching service for "lighter living"--saving money and the planet through smarter spending, healthy eating, and eco- and ethically-friendly habits. Simplease had an innovative business model and passionate early adopters, but it struggled to cross the chasm and become sustainable at scale.

DDI partnered with Simplease to find the *why* behind their stalling growth. We applied data analytics, Agile research, and the Darden Strategic Innovation framework to study customer segments, business partners, competitors, and other identified stakeholders. With a little digging, DDI and Simplease confirmed that the core insights were solid: Simplease's customers (and most people, really) do care about lighter living, but they are worried they can't afford a lifestyle change and overwhelmed by starting. We also discovered, however, a critical understanding of how a customer's social environment factored into her purchase decision. 

Building on these new insights, we've used Lean Startup and customer development practices to experiment toward an exciting new business model gaining traction among private alpha users. Look for a public alpha announcement this fall!
