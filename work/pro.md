#Non-Profit Volunteer Engagement and Cost Efficiency

<p class="lead">Modernizing volunteerism to raise money for people with disabilities.</p>

A prominent Chicagoland non-profit serving people with mental and developmental disabilities holds their largest fundraiser every year, and every year the amount raised has always been a direct function of the number of volunteers. When the lead event organizer retired, howeer, she took several personal connections with her. Facing further cuts to state funding, our client needed to do more with less and activate at least as many volunteers as in previous years.

DDI developed a simple web interface for volunteers to sign up then forward along to their friends and a web dashboard that event coordinators could easily access, and we integratd it with the existing volunteer database. The digital solution generated enough new volunteer sign-ups to maintain historical volunteer engagement and, as a bonus, slashed hours of manual labor off the preparation of the fundraiser--so many, in fact, our client was able to run the event without ever filling the lead organizer's position.
